# Coy

**Coy** is a lightweight, experimental game engine. It attempts to combine the [simplicity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGlVcSMgtV4) of the [Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) with the [easiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oytL881p-nQ) of [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk). 

## Contributing
If you're in the Carp community, you almost certainly know more about C, Carp, and game programming than I do. Feel free to leave issues or make PRs.
